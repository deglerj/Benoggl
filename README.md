## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
./gradlew build
```

If you want to build an _Ã¼ber-jar_, execute the following command:
```shell script
./gradlew build -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: 
```shell script
./gradlew build -Dquarkus.package.type=native
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using: 
```shell script
./gradlew build -Dquarkus.package.type=native -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```
